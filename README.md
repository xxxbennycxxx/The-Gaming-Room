# The-Gaming-Room

• Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room, the client in question, sought the expertise of CTS to create a web-based gaming application that would function across multiple platforms. This application was intended to be an extension of their existing game, Draw It or Lose It, which at the time was exclusively available as an Android app. The software requirements included stipulations such as only one instance of the game being active in memory at any moment, the necessity for unique and searchable game and team names, the formation of teams consisting of several players, and the capability for games to include multiple teams. 

• What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
In developing the documentation, I believe I conducted comprehensive research to identify the options that best aligned with the client’s needs. It is crucial to remain objective and avoid biases when making suggestions, as the client’s requirements can vary widely. The research and information presented demonstrate to the client that their interests are prioritized in the final product. 

• What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Utilizing an SDT is advantageous during code development, as it serves as a roadmap for the objectives to be achieved. This approach ensures optimal use of time and resources, eliminating uncertainty regarding the client's expectations. The requirements have been explicitly defined and mutually agreed upon.

• If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If given the opportunity to revise one section of the SDT, I would aim to make it more succinct. By refining the statements to be brief and direct, I could enhance communication between the client and myself. A key takeaway from the documentation process is the importance of leaving no room for ambiguity. 
• How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I evaluated the user requirements for Draw It or Lose It to guarantee a seamless user experience, simplicity in usage, and the security of their information. Addressing user needs is vital because they are the end-users of the product. If users are dissatisfied or do not have a positive experience, they are less likely to engage with, purchase, or show interest in other products from the same company. 

• How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
My design strategy centered on fulfilling the client’s requirements and producing high-quality documentation. Properly documenting the code will facilitate future adaptations for other applications. This approach ensures that either I or another developer can easily comprehend the functionality of each code segment and how it can be utilized to satisfy their requirements.
